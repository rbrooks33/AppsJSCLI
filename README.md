# AppsJSCLI
Automates template creation. 
Place run.bat in same folder as dll and run.
It reads config.json which creates Components according to those configured in the AppsJS components.json file. No parameters; trying to keep things automatic and uncomplicated. 

All suggestions toward that goal are welcome! Rodney rbrooks33@gmail.com
